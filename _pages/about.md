Hi, I’m **Chenhuan Cai**—thanks for stopping by.  
I’m currently pursuing an M.S. in Artificial Intelligence at the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html).  
My research interests focus on **Computer Vision** and **Machine Learning**.

### Maybe a bit more...
During my undergraduate studies, I explored machine learning and won my first computing-related prize in the [Mathematical Contest in Modeling](/research-and-projects/#cummcm). That experience motivated me to enter further competitions in machine learning, data mining, and data analysis, and a research internship at [McGill University](/experience/#mcgill).

I then delved into computer vision: I took part in several competitions including rock-image classification, underwater starfish detection, later earned a silver medal in the [Stable Diffusion: Image-to-Prompts](/research-and-projects/#stable-diffusion) challenge. I also interned at [NetEase](/experience/#netease) as a computer vision algorithm engineer, and co-authored a paper on [Dense Video Captioning](/publications/#star-ecai-paper).

Now I am pursuing an M.S. in AI at UZH and conducting 3-D vision research with the [CVG lab at ETH Zurich](/experience/#ethz).
