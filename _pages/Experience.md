<span style="color: #205ea6; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.3em;"> 3D Vision Research Assistant @ _ETH Zurich_ </span> 

As a Research Assistant in the Computer Vision Group (CVG) at ETH Zurich under **Prof.&nbsp;Marc Pollefeys**, my duties include:

- **Project foundation:** Extended *NoPoSplat*—a pose-free 3D-Gaussian reconstruction method—to attain higher quality under sparse, low-overlap views.  
- **Multi-view extension:** Integrated a Fusion Transformer to fuse information from additional viewpoints.  
- **Intrinsic-free pipeline:** Replaced camera-intrinsic embeddings with a prediction network, making the system independent of intrinsic parameters.  
- **Generative prior:** Introduced a diffusion-model prior for 3D Gaussians, markedly improving reconstruction quality and stability.

<span style="color: #205ea6; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.3em;"> Computer Vision Algorithm Engineer @ _NetEase_ </span> 

As a Computer Vision Algorithm Engineer at Youdao (NetEase), my duties included:

- Led the *finger-on-paper contact* module for the *Aladdin* smart desk lamp, driving feasibility studies and visual-detection R & D.  
- **Phase 1:** Generated pseudo-labels, performed preprocessing, and benchmarked YOLOv5/YOLOX, achieving reliable separation under lights-on conditions.  
- **Phase 2:** Expanded the dataset, applied extensive augmentation and tracking-based methods, and trained a model that surpassed **80 % accuracy** in lights-off scenarios—enabling integration into later product releases.

As a Machine Learning Research Assistant at McGill University under **Prof.&nbsp;Ding Jun**, my duties included:

- Developed bioinformatics and active-learning tools; built a Dash-based web app for file I/O, AnnData preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and visualization.  
- Processed single-cell data using *Scanpy* and inferred cellular trajectories with *Velocyto* to study lung epithelial cell differentiation.
