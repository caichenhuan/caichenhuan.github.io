<span style="color: #205ea6; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.3em;"> Enhancing Multi-view 3D Reconstruction</span>

This project builds on NoPoSplat, a pose-free method that reconstructs 3-D Gaussian scenes from sparse multi-view images without known camera poses. We aim to raise reconstruction quality when viewpoints are few and overlap is minimal. My duty includes:
- **Multi-view extension**: Incorporate a Fusion Transformer into NoPoSplat to fuse information from additional viewpoints.
- **Intrinsic-free reconstruction**: Replace the traditional camera-intrinsic embedding with a prediction network, aiming for a pipeline that is completely independent of intrinsic parameters.
- **Generative prior**: Introduce a diffusion model as a generative prior for 3D Gaussians, markedly boosting both the quality and stability of the reconstruction.

*ECAI 2025 [PDF](/files/STAR-ECAI.pdf)*  

<img src="/images/STAR流程图.png" alt="Stable Diffusion Example" style="max-width: 100%; margin: 16px 0;">


This project focuses on **long-form dense video captioning (DVC)**, which detects multiple event segments in untrimmed videos and generates a natural-language description for each one. Our main contributions are:

- **STaR framework** Propose **STaR**, which integrates global, local, and spatial cues through multi-granular spatio-temporal reasoning.  
- **SSS and CC modules** Introduce **SSS** (for spatial-position awareness) and **CC** (for global-context understanding).  
- **LLM-enhanced captions** Incorporate a large language model (LLM) into STaR, significantly improving caption quality on the **SoccerNet-Caption** dataset.

*Kaggle Competition · Silver Medal (Top 5 %)*  
<!-- <img src="/images/stablediffusion-eg1.png" alt="Stable Diffusion Example" style="max-width: 100%; margin: 16px 0;"> -->

This project focuses on predicting the original text prompts given images generated by Stable Diffusion. The goal is to accurately recover descriptive prompts from synthetic images, enabling better understanding and reverse engineering of generative models. Our contributions include:

- **Dataset creation** Verified feasibility on COCO and the official SD2-v2 sets, then built a 1.8 M-image training set by pairing POLO labels with SD2-v2 generations.  
- **Model training** Encoded prompts into 384-dimensional vectors using a Sentence-Transformer; projected images into the same space with ViT or ConvNeXt and minimized cosine-distance loss.  
- **Model refinement** Raised input resolution, applied layer-wise learning rates (higher in lower, task-specific blocks), re-initialized the final linear layer, disabled dropout, and added adversarial weight perturbation (AWP) for extra robustness.  
- **Inference & ensembling** Merged four cross-validation folds with one full-data model (five sub-models total) and used weight-search ensembling for the final predictions.

<span style="color: #205ea6; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.3em;"> China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling</span>  
*2nd Prize (Top 3.3 %)* 

Conducted quantitative analysis and modeling on a chemical-experiment dataset. My duty includes:

- Built a correlation-coefficient matrix, ran OLS regression, and used goodness-of-fit tests to study variable relationships.  
- Trained several models and selected **XGBoost + SHAP** to quantify feature importance.  
- Applied an improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimise the final objective and maximise the target value.
